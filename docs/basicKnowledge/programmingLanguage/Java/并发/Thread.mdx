# 线程

### 线程状态

* 新建（New）
    * 创建一个线程对象
* 就绪（Runnable）
    * start()，yield()方法，该线程处于就绪状态，等待获取cpu的使用权。
* 运行（running）
    * 可运行状态的线程获得了cpu时间片（timeslice），执行程序代码。注：就绪状态是进入到运行状态的唯一入口
* 阻塞（Blocked）
    * 等待获取阻塞锁，如：：synchronized
* 等待（Waiting）
* 超时等待（TimedWaiting）
* 死亡（Terminated）
    * 线程run()方法执行结束，或者因异常退出了run()方法，则该线程结束生命周期
